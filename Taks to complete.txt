Deadline (by Nov 8th):
----------------------
1) Divide creating labels among ourselves.
	Yuryi		-	1-25 Roof images & 1-25 facade images
	Chaitanya	-	25-50 Roof images & 25-50 facade images
	Harika		-	50-75 Roof images & 50-75 facade images
	Praveen		-	75-100 Roof images & 75-100 facade images
2) We all have to use same label names, I'm thinking to have
	Roof
	Facade
	Sky
	Road
	Trees
3) Crop the facade images, remove the segmented image associated with it.
